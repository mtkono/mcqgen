Now that the Vatican has renewed  its insidious  secret  agreement  with China,  \\na deal which  you have  repeatedly condemned  as promoted by Bergoglio with \\nthe assistance  of McCarrick,  what  can the “children  of light” of the Great  \\nAwakening concretely do to undermine  this unholy  alliance  with this brutal  \\nCommunist  regime?  \\n \\nThe dictatorship  of the Chinese  Communist  Party  is allied  to the global  \\ndeep  state , on the one hand  so that together  they can attain  the goals  \\nthat they have in common, on the other  hand because  the plans  for the \\nGreat  Reset  are an opportunity to increase the economic power  of China  \\nin the world, beginning with the invasion of national  markets.  At the \\nsame time that it pursues  this project  in its foreign policy, China  is \\npursuing a domestic  plan to restore  the Maoist  tyranny, which  requires  \\nthe cancellation  of religions  (primarily  the Catholic  religion), replacing  \\nthem  with a religion  of the State  which  definitely  has many  elements  in \\ncommon with the universal  religion  desired  by globalist  ideology,  \\nwhose  spiritual leader  is Bergoglio. \\n The complicity  of Bergoglio’ s deep  church  in this infernal  project  has \\ndeprived Chinese  Catholics  of the indefectible  defense that the Papacy  \\nhad always  been  for them.  Up until the papacy  of Benedict  XVI,  the \\npapacy  had not made any agreements  with the Beijing  dictatorship, and \\nthe Roman  Pontiff  retained  the exclusive  right  to appoint  bishops  and \\ngovern dioceses.  I recall  that even  at the time of the Bill Clinton  \\nadministration  during the 1990’ s, former Cardinal  McCarrick  was the \\npoint  of contact  between  the deep  church  and the American  deep  state , \\ncarrying  out political missions  in China  on behalf  of the US \\nadministration.  And the suspicions  that the resignation of Benedict  XVI \\ninvolved China  are quite  strong and coherent  with the picture  that has \\nbeen  emerging in  recent  months.  \\n Thus  we find ourselves  faced  with an infamous  betrayal  of the mission  \\nof the Church of Christ,  carried  out by her highest  leaders  in open \\nPagina  2 di 6 \\nconflict  with those  members  of the Chinese  Cath olic underground \\nhierarchy  who have  remained  faithful  to Our Lord  and to His Church. \\nMy affectioned  thoughts  and prayers  are with them  and with Cardinal  \\nZen, an eminent  confessor  of the faith,  whom  Bergoglio recently  \\nshamefully  refused  to receive.  \\n \\nWe believers  must  act on the spiritual level  by fervent  prayer,  asking \\nGod to give special  protection  to the Church in China, and also by \\ncontinually denouncing the aberrations  carried  out by the Chinese  \\nregime.  This action  must  be accompanied  by a work  of raisin g \\nawareness  within  governments  and international  institutions  that have \\nnot been  compromised by the Chinese  communist  dictatorship, so that \\nthe violations  of human  rights  and the attacks  on the freedom  of the \\nCatholic  Church in China  may be denounced  and punished with \\nsanctions  and strong  diplomatic  pressure.  And this is the line that \\nPresident  Trump  is pursuing with decisive courage.  Beijing ’s \\ncomplicity  with political and religious  elements  that are involved in \\nmurky operations  of speculation  and corrupti on must  likewise  be \\nexposed. These profit -driven dealings  constitute  a very grave act of \\ntreason  by politicians  and public  officials  against  their nation and also \\na grave  betrayal  of the Church by the men who lead her. I also think  \\nthat in some  cases  this betrayal  is not only carried  out by individuals  \\nbut also by the institutions  themselves,  as in the case of the European  \\nUnion, which  is currently  finalizing  a commercial  agreement  with \\nChina  despite  its systematic  violation  of human rights  and its violent  \\nrepression  of dissent.  \\n \\nIt would be an irreparable disaster  if Joe Biden, who is heavily  \\nsuspected  of being complicit with the Chinese  dictatorship, would be \\ndesignated  as President  of the United  States.  \\n 2. You have  been  very confident  that God desires a Trump  victory in order  to \\ndefeat  the forces  of evil inherent  in the globalists ’ Great  Reset.  What  would you \\nsay to convince the naysayers  who are ambivalent  to the idea that this is a \\nmomentous  battle  between  the children  of light and the children  of darkness?  \\n \\nI simply  consider  who Trump ’s adversary  is and his numerous  ties to \\nChina, the deep  state , and the advocates  of globalist  ideology. I think \\nof his intention  to condemn us all to wear  masks,  as he has candidly \\nadmitted.  I think of the fact that, incontestably, he is only a puppet  in \\nthe hands  of the elite,  who are ready  to remove  him as soon they decide \\nto replace him  with  Kamala Harris.   \\n Beyond the political alignments, we must  further understand that – \\nabove  all in a complex  situation  like the present  one – it is essential  that \\nthe victory of the one who is elected  President  must  be guaranteed  in \\nits absolute  legal  legitimacy,  avoiding any suspicion of fraud  and taking  Pagina  3 di 6 \\nnote of the overwhelming  evidence  of irregularities  that has emerged  in \\nseveral  states.  A President  who is simply  proclaimed  as such by the \\nmainstream  media  affiliated  with the deep  state  would be deprived  of \\nall legitimacy  and would  expose  the nation  to dangerous  foreign  \\ninterference,  as has already  been  shown to have happened in the current  \\nelection.  \\n \\n3. You seem  to suggest  that the Trump  Administration  could be  instrumental  in \\nhelping to return  the Church  to a pre-Francis  Catholicism.  How  does the Trump  \\nAdministration  accomplish that, and how can American  Catholics  work  to save \\nthe world from  this globalist  ‘reset ’? \\n \\nBergoglio’ s subservience  to the globalist  agenda  is obvious, as well as \\nhis active support  for the election  of Joe Biden. In the same way,  \\nBergoglio’ s hostility  to Trump  and his repeated  attacks  against  the \\nPresident  are evident . It is clear  that Bergoglio considers  Trump  as his \\nprincipal  adversary,  the obstacle that needs  to be removed, so that the \\nGreat  Reset  can be put in motion.  \\n \\nThus  on the one hand we have  the Trump  administration  and the \\ntraditional values  that it holds  in common  with those  of Catholics; on \\nthe other  hand  we have the deep  state  of the self-styled Catholic  Joe \\nBiden, who is subservient  to the globalist ideology and its perverse,  \\nanti-human, antichristic,  infernal  agenda.   \\n \\nIn order  to put an end to the deep  church  and restore  the Catholic  \\nChurch, the extent  of the involvement  of the leaders  of the Church with \\nthe Masonic -globalist  project  will have  to be revealed:  the nature  of the \\ncorruption and crimes  that these men have  carried  out, thereby  making  \\nthemselves  vulnerable  to blackmail,  just as happens  in a similar  way  in \\nthe political field to members  of the deep  state , beginning with Biden  \\nhimself.  Thus  it is to be hoped that any proof  of such crimes  that is in \\nthe possession  of the Secret  Services  would be brought  to light,  \\nespecially  in relation  to the true motives  that led to the resignation of \\nBenedict  XVI and the conspiracies  underlying the election  of \\nBergoglio, thereby  permitting  the expulsion of the mercenaries  who \\nhave  seized  control  of the Church.  \\n \\nAmerican  Catholics  still have  time to denounce  this global  subversion \\nand stop the establi shment  of the New  Order:  let them  think about  what  \\nsort of future  they want  for the coming generations,  and of the \\ndestruction of  society.  Let them  think  about  the responsibility  that they  \\nhave  before  God, their children, and their nation:  as Catholics,  as fathers  \\nand mothers  of their  families,  and as patriots.   \\n 4. Against  all odds, average  Americans  are fighting  to expose the massive  and \\ncoordinated theft of our election:  what  advice  would you give to our recalcitrant  Pagina  4 di 6 \\npoliticians  about  what  is at stake for our nation and the world if we submit  to \\nthis theft?  \\n \\nThe Truth  can be denied  by the majority  for a certain  amount  of time,  \\nor by some  people  forever,  but it can never  be hidden from  everyone  \\nforever.  This is the lesson  of History, which  has inexorably revealed  the \\ngreat  crimes  of the past and those  who  perpetrated  them.  \\n \\nThus  I invite  politicians,  beyond their political loyalties,  to become  \\nchampions  of the Truth, to defend  it as an indispensable  treasure  which  \\nalone  can guarantee the credibility  of institutions  and the authority of \\nthe people ’s representatives,  in accord  with the mandate they have  \\nreceived,  the oath they have  sworn  to serve their country, and their \\nmoral  responsibility  before  God. Each  one of us has a role that \\nProvidence  has entrusted  to us, and which  it would  be culpable  to shrink \\nfrom.  If the United  States  misses this opportunity, now, it will be wiped  \\nout from  History. If it allows  the idea to spread  among the masses  that \\nthe electoral  choice  of the citizens  – the first expres sion of democracy  \\n– can be manipulated  and thwarted,  it will be complicit in the fraud,  and \\nwill certainly  deserve the execration  of the entire  world, which  looks  to \\nAmerica as a nation which  has fought  for and  defended  its freedom.    \\n \\n5. In your letter  to the President  on October  25, the Solemnity  of Christ  the \\nKing, you spoke  of the efforts  of the deep  state  as “the final assault  of the \\nchildren  of darkness.”  There  is a concerted  effort by the globalists  and their  \\nmedia  partners  to conceal  and obscure  the true tyrannical  agenda implicit in \\nthe Great  Reset,  by calling  it a wild conspiracy  theory.  What  would you say to \\nthe skeptics  who blissfully  ignore  the signs  and plan to submit  humanity  to the \\ndomination of  the global  elites?  \\n \\nThe plan of the Great  Reset  makes  use of the mainstream  media  as an \\nindispensable  ally: the media corporations  are almost  all actively  part \\nof the deep  state  and know  that the power  that will be guaranteed  to \\nthem  in the future  depends  exclusively  on their  slavish  adherence to  its \\nagenda.  \\n \\nLabeling  those  who denounce  the existence  of a conspiracy as \\n“conspiracy theorists ” confirms,  if anything, that this conspiracy  exists,  \\nand that its authors  are very upset  at having been  found out and reported  \\nto public  opinion. And yet they themselves  have  said it: Nothing will be \\nthe same  again. And also: Build  Back Better , in an effort  to make us \\nbelieve that the radical  changes  they want  to impose  have  been  made \\nnecessary  by a pandemic,  by climate  change,  and by technologica l \\nprogress.  \\n Years  ago, those  who spoke  of the New  World  Order  were called  \\nconspiracy  theorists . Today, all of the world ’s leaders,  including Pagina  5 di 6 \\nBergoglio, speak  with impunity about  the New  World  Order,  describing  \\nit exactly  in the terms  that were identified  by the so-called  conspiracy  \\ntheorists . It is enough to  read the globalists ’ declarations  to understand  \\nthat the conspiracy exists  and that they pride  themselves  on being its \\narchitects,  to the point  of admitting  the need  for a  pandemic  in order  to \\nreach  their objectives  of social  engineering.  \\n \\nTo the skeptics  I ask: if the models  that are proposed to  us today  are so  \\nterrible,  what  will our children  be able to expect  when  the elite will have \\nsucceeded  in taking total control  over the nations?  Families  without  \\nfather  and mother, polyamory, sodomy, children  who can change their \\nsex, the cancellation  of Religion  and the imposition  of an infernal  cult, \\nabortion and euthanasia,  the abolition  of private  property, a health  \\ndictatorship, a perpetual  pandemic.  Is this the world  that we want,  that \\nyou want  for yourselves, your children, and  your  family  and friends?  \\n \\nWe must all become  aware of how much  the proponents  of the New  \\nWorld  Order and the Great  Reset  hate the inalienable  values  of our \\nGreco -Christian  civilization,  such as Religion , the family,  respect  for \\nlife and the inviolable  rights  of the human person, and national  \\nsovereignty.  \\n \\n6. You have  repeatedly  warned that the ‘deep  state ’ and ‘deep  church ’ have \\ncolluded to plot in various  ways  to overthrow  Benedict  as well as President  \\nTrump. Besides  Theodore  McCarrick,  who else is behind this infernal  alliance,  \\nand how  do Catholics  undermine  and expose  it? \\n \\nIt is apparent  that McCarrick  acted  on behalf  of the deep  state  and the \\ndeep  church , but he certainly  did not do it alone. All of his activity  \\nsuggests  a very efficient  organizational  structure  composed  of people  \\nwhom  McCarrick  had promoted and  covered  by other  accomplices.   \\n The events  that led to the resignation of Benedict  XVI still need  to be \\nclarified,  but one of the members  of the deep  church, the deceased  \\nCardinal  Danneels,  a Jesuit  like Bergoglio,  admitted  that he was a part \\nof the so-called  Saint  Gallen  Mafia , which  essentially  worked to bring \\nabout  the “springtime  of the Church”  which  John Podesta,  Hillary  \\nClinton ’s chief  of staff,  wrote  about  in his emails  published by \\nWikileaks.  \\n Thus  there is a group of conspirators  who have  worked and still work  \\nin the heart  of the Church  for the interests  of the elite.  Most  of them  are \\nidentifiable,  but the most  dangerous  are those  who do not expose  \\nthemselves,  those  whom  the newspaper  never  mentions. They will not \\nhesitate  to force  Bergoglio to resign  also, just like Ratzinger,  if he does \\nnot obey their orders.  They  would like to transform  the Vatican  into a \\nretirement  home  for popes  emeriti , demolishing the papacy  and Pagina  6 di 6 \\nsecuring  power:  exactly  the same  as what  happens  in the deep  state , \\nwhere,  as I have already  said, Biden  is the equivalent  of Bergoglio. \\n \\nIn order  to bring down the  deep  state  and the deep  church , three things  \\nare essential:  \\n 1) first of all, becoming aware of what  globalism ’s plan is, and to what  \\nextent  it is instrumental to the establishment of the kingdom  of the \\nAntichrist,  since it shares  its principles, means,  and ends;  \\n \\n2) secondly, firmly  denouncing this infernal  plan and asking the \\nShepherds  of the Church – and also the laity – to defend  her, \\nbreaking their complicit silence:  God will demand  of them  an \\naccount  for their  desertion;  \\n \\n3) finally,  it is necessary  to pray, asking the Lord  to grant  each one of \\nus the strength to resist  – resistite  fortes  in fide, Saint  Peter  warns  \\nus – against  the ideological  tyranny that is daily  imposed on us not \\nonly by the media  but also by the cardinals  and bishops  who are \\nunder  Bergoglio’ s thumb. \\n \\nIf we  can prove  ourselves  strong in  facing  this trial; if  we know  how  to \\nhold ourselves  anchored  to the rock of the Church without  allowing  \\nourselves  to be seduced  by false  christs and false  prophets , the Lord  \\nwill permit us  to see – at  least for now  – the  defeat  of the assault  of the \\nchildren  of darkness  against  God and men.  If out of fear or complicity  \\nwe follow  the prince of this world, denying our Baptismal promises, we \\nwill be condemned with him to inexorable  defeat  and eternal  \\ndamnation. I tremble  for those  who do not realize the responsibility  that \\nthey have  before  God for the souls  that He has entrusted  to them.  But \\nto those  who fight  courageously to defend  the rights  of God, the Nation,  \\nand the Family,  the Lord  assures  his protection. He has placed  His Most  \\nHoly  Mother  at our side, the Queen  of Victories  and the Help  of \\nChristians.  We invoke  Her faithfully  during these difficult days,  \\nconfidently certain  of Her intervention.  \\n  \\n + Carlo  Maria Vigan ò, Archbishop \\n  \\nDie Octavæ  Nativitatis  Domini  \\nJanuary  1\\nst, 2021  ',\n",
